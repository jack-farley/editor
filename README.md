# Editor

This is a shared document editor that I build using the Operational Transformation algorithm. 

Right now there is no persistent document storage, user accounts or the ability to import documents. For this version, I focused on getting the concurrency correct, which ended up being pretty involved.

I will continue to work on this and try to build out more features.

(There is currently a bug in the client that moves the cursor to the end of the document every time text is added. I am working on fixing that.)
